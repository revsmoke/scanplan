# ArchiNet RoomPlan
## Professional Room Scanning for Architects

ArchiNet RoomPlan is a professional-grade iOS application that transforms Apple's RoomPlan API into a comprehensive tool for architects, engineers, and construction professionals. Built upon a solid foundation, we're evolving this application to deliver survey-grade accuracy with the simplicity of a smartphone app.

### üéØ Vision
*"To become the definitive mobile scanning solution for architectural professionals, delivering survey-grade accuracy with the simplicity of a smartphone app."*

## üìã Project Status

**Current Phase**: Foundation Enhancement (Months 1-3)
**Next Milestone**: Multi-scan fusion and professional export pipeline
**Target Market**: Architects, Engineers, Construction Professionals

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- App Store compliance (Privacy manifest, proper bundle ID, entitlements)
- Performance optimizations with device-adaptive rendering
- Enhanced error handling and memory management
- Clean architecture with comprehensive testing foundation

### üöß In Development
- Multi-scan fusion for improved accuracy
- Professional export formats (IFC, DWG, Point Cloud)
- Quality assurance dashboard
- Cloud infrastructure for team collaboration

## üìö Documentation

- **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./docs/PRD.md)** - Comprehensive product roadmap and specifications
- **[Development Roadmap](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)** - Technical implementation plan and milestones
- **[Implementation History](./IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - Recent code improvements and technical enhancements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Environment Setup

Run `./setup.sh` before building the project to install required build tools.

### Current Features
- **Room Scanning**: Apple RoomPlan API integration with enhanced accuracy
- **Export Formats**: USDZ (3D models) and JSON (parametric data) with `.all` export option
- **Performance Optimized**: Device-adaptive rendering for smooth operation
- **Professional UI**: Clean interface designed for architectural workflows

### Upcoming Professional Features
- **Multi-Scan Fusion**: Combine multiple scans for ¬±5mm accuracy
- **CAD Integration**: Direct export to Revit, AutoCAD, SketchUp
- **Team Collaboration**: Cloud-based project sharing and review
- **Quality Validation**: Real-time accuracy feedback and professional certification

## Export Accuracy

The app exports the captured space to both **USDZ** and **JSON** formats. To
provide architects with the most detailed reference possible, the export uses
`CapturedRoom.ExportOption.all`. This option includes the parametric data and the
raw mesh in the same USDZ file so downstream tools can choose the level of
precision they require.
