        // Register import/export commands
        // Setup automatic sync with mobile app
    }
}
```

#### **Advanced Measurement Tools**
```swift
// Precision Measurement System
class AdvancedMeasurementTools {
    func measurePointToPoint(_ start: SCNVector3, _ end: SCNVector3) -> PreciseMeasurement
    func measureAngles(_ points: [SCNVector3]) -> AngleMeasurement
    func calculateAreas(_ boundary: [SCNVector3]) -> AreaMeasurement
    func analyzeVolumes(_ roomGeometry: RoomGeometry) -> VolumeMeasurement
}
```

#### **Collaboration Platform**
```swift
// Team Collaboration System
class CollaborationManager {
    func shareProject(_ project: ScanProject, with team: [TeamMember])
    func syncChanges(_ localChanges: [ProjectChange]) -> SyncResult
    func managePermissions(_ user: User, for project: ScanProject)
    func trackVersions(_ project: ScanProject) -> [ProjectVersion]
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Market Leadership (Months 7-12)

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- AI-powered scan enhancement
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Advanced analytics and reporting

    func classifyMaterials(_ surfaceData: SurfaceData) -> MaterialClassification
    func detectAnomalies(_ scanData: RoomData) -> [Anomaly]
    func predictMissingGeometry(_ partialScan: PartialRoomData) -> CompletedScan
}
```

#### **Enterprise Features**
```swift
// Enterprise Security & Compliance
class EnterpriseManager {
    func implementSOC2Compliance() -> ComplianceStatus
    func setupSSOIntegration(_ provider: SSOProvider) -> AuthResult
    func manageEnterpriseAccounts(_ organization: Organization)
    func generateAuditReports() -> [AuditReport]
}
