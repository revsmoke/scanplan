How to Use This Rubric
	1.	Assessment: For each criterion, rate the app on a scale from 1 (Poor) to 4 (Excellent) based on the descriptors.
	2.	Feedback: Use the ratings to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.
	3.	Iteration: Prioritize improvements in areas that receive lower scores to enhance the overall quality and user satisfaction.

This rubric is designed to be adaptable depending on the specific context of the app and its intended audience. Feel free to modify criteria or descriptions to better suit your project’s unique requirements.
